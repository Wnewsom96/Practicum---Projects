# Data

- id — unique oil well identifier
- f0, f1, f2 — three features of points (their specific meaning is unimportant, but the features themselves are significant)
- product — volume of reserves in the oil well (thousand barrels)

# Goal
Analyzing data from several petroleum reservoir regions and oil wells to calculate the profitability and risk of loss of developing a new well in each region

# Libraries
*pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn*
