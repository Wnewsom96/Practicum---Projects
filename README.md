# Practicum---Projects
Here is a compliation of  Data Science projects I completed while in the Data Science bootcamp in Practicum by Yandex. They involve Data Preprocessing, Analysis and Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Machine Learning for texts, Time Series, Computer Vision, etc.
